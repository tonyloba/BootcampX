BootcampX DB:

The main entities for this application will be:
///
students
cohorts
assignments
assignment_submissions
teachers
assistance_requests

We're going to start off simple and just focus on the queries for two entities: students and cohorts.

A cohort will have the following attributes:
// COHORT:
id: A unique identifier
name: The name of the cohort
start_date: The cohorts' start date
end_date: The cohorts' end date

A student will have the following attributes:
//Student:
id: A unique identifier
name: The full name of the student
email: The students' email address
phone: The students' phone number
github: The students' github profile url
start_date: The students' start date of the Bootcamp
end_date: The students' end date of the Bootcamp
cohort_id: The id of the cohort that the student is enrolled in


An assignment will have the following attributes:
// Assignment: 
id: A unique identifier
name: The name of the assignment
content: The written content body of the assignment
day: The day that the assignment appears on
chapter: The order that the assignment will appear in the day.
duration: The average time it takes a student to finish

An assignment_submission will have the following attributes:
// Assignment_submission:
id: A unique identifier
assignment_id: The id of the assignment
student_id: The id of the student
duration: The time it took the student to complete the assignment
submission_date: The date is was submitted
A student will be able to submit an assignment_submissions for every single assignment. So a student will submit many assignment_submissions and an assignment will have many assignment_submissions associated with it.
